# PyTorch Trainer

The project implements a trainer package, which trains 3 different models on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This package is for educational purposes.

----------------------------
## Code Execution
The following command should be run from terminal: <br>
    <code>python __main__.py --model_name <i>model_name</i></code>
-----------------------------
## Models
The first 2 models don't really have names, so we've called them "model_1" and "model_2". The third possible model to use is "resnet50".
Note: resnet50 is trained for only 7 epochs, in contrast to the 30 epochs of the other 2 models.
