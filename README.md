# PyTorch Trainer

The project implements a trainer package, which trains 3 different models on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This package is for educational purposes.

----------------------------
## Code Execution
The following command should be run from terminal: <br>
    <code>python3 -m src.pytorch_trainer.pytorchTrainer --model_name model_1</code>
-----------------------------
## Models
The first 2 models don't really have names, so we've called them "model_1" and "model_2". The third possible model to use is "vgg19".
